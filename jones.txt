Some interesting facts I've learned in the last few days:

1) The justices of the U.S. Supreme Court are the sole deciders of what cases the Court will hear.
2) Git was invented by Linus Torvalds, who is most famous for inventing the Linux kernel
3) Icebergs are made of fresh water. (Icebergs are glacier fragments that have fallen into the sea.)
